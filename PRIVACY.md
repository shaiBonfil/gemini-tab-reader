Privacy Policy for Gemini Tab Reader

Last Updated: August 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Gemini Tab Reader" Chrome Extension ("the Extension"), developed by Shai Bonfil, handles your information.

**1. Information We Handle**

The Extension requires two pieces of information to function:

* **Your Google Gemini API Key:** You must provide your own API key for the Google Gemini service. This key is stored locally and securely in your browser's synchronized storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). It is never transmitted to us or any other third party besides Google for the purpose of authenticating API requests.

* **Web Page Content:** When you submit a question, the text content of your active browser tab is sent to the Google Gemini API along with your question to generate a response. This data is not stored, saved, or logged by the Extension itself. It is processed in-memory and sent directly to Google's servers.

**2. How We Use Information**

* Your **API Key** is used exclusively to authenticate you with the Google Gemini API.
* **Web Page Content** is used exclusively to provide context to the Gemini model to answer your questions.

**3. Data Storage and Security**

Your API key is stored using `chrome.storage.sync`, which synchronizes it across your logged-in Chrome browsers. We do not have access to this key. All other data, such as page content and questions, is not stored by the Extension.

**4. Third-Party Services**

The Extension's core functionality relies on the Google Gemini API. Your use of the Extension is subject to Google's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We are not responsible for Google's data handling practices.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
